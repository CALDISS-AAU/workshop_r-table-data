## THIS WORKSHOP SERIES WILL COVER

* Working with table data (data frames) in RStudio
* Working with numerical and textual data in tables in RStudio
* Essential data-wrangling skills: Variable recoding, data merging and so on with the tidyverse package
* Using R programming tools to automate data-wrangling tasks
* Doing descriptive statistics in R (tables, crosstables and basic visualizations)
* Doing parametric statistics in R (linear and logistic regression models)
* Visualizing your results in R with ggplot2
